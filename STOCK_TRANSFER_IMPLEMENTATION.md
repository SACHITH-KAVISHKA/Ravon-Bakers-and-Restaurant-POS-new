# Stock Transfer Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Stock Transfer system for the Ravon Bakers and Restaurant POS system that allows supervisors to transfer stock between branches while ensuring proper authorization and inventory management.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Structure
- **stock_transfers table**: Main transfer records with status tracking
- **stock_transfer_items table**: Individual items in each transfer
- **Updated inventories table**: Added branch_id for branch-specific inventory management
- **Proper relationships**: Foreign keys and constraints for data integrity

### 2. Models Created
- **StockTransfer**: Main transfer model with relationships to branches, users, and items
- **StockTransferItem**: Individual transfer items with quantity tracking
- **Updated Inventory**: Now supports branch-specific inventory
- **Updated User & Branch**: Added stock transfer relationships

### 3. Controllers & Logic
- **StockTransferController**: Handles all stock transfer operations
  - `create()`: Shows transfer creation form (supervisor only)
  - `store()`: Processes new transfer requests
  - `index()`: Lists supervisor's transfer history
  - `pending()`: Shows pending transfers for branch staff
  - `accept()`: Accepts transfers and updates inventory
  - `reject()`: Rejects transfers with reason
  - `show()`: Shows transfer details
  - `getInventory()`: AJAX endpoint for real-time inventory checks

### 4. Views Created
- **Supervisor Views**:
  - `create.blade.php`: Transfer creation form with dynamic item selection
  - `index.blade.php`: Transfer history with status tracking
- **Staff Views**:
  - `pending.blade.php`: Pending transfers requiring action
  - `show.blade.php`: Detailed transfer view
- **Updated Dashboard**: Added transfer statistics and recent transfers

### 5. Navigation & Access Control
- **Supervisor Navigation**: Added "Stock Transfer" menu item
- **Staff Navigation**: Added "Pending Transfers" menu item
- **Gate-based Authorization**: Proper permission checking throughout

## User Workflows

### Supervisor Workflow
1. **Create Transfer**: Access via sidebar → Stock Transfer → Create New Transfer
2. **Select Branch**: Choose destination branch from dropdown
3. **Add Items**: Select items with real-time availability checking
4. **Submit Request**: Creates pending transfer for destination branch
5. **Track Status**: View all transfers and their statuses in history

### Branch Staff Workflow
1. **View Pending**: Access via sidebar → Pending Transfers
2. **Review Details**: See all transfer items and quantities
3. **Accept/Reject**: 
   - **Accept**: Automatically updates inventory in both branches and POS
   - **Reject**: Requires reason, no inventory changes

## Key Business Rules Implemented

### Authorization
- Only supervisors can create transfers
- Only destination branch staff can accept/reject
- Users can only see transfers relevant to their branch
- Proper role-based access control throughout

### Inventory Management
- Real-time availability checking during transfer creation
- Automatic inventory updates on acceptance:
  - Deducts from source branch
  - Adds to destination branch
- No inventory changes on rejection or pending status

### Data Integrity
- Transfer quantities cannot exceed available stock
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate inventory records
- Proper foreign key relationships ensure data consistency

### POS Integration
- Only accepted transfers affect POS inventory
- Pending and rejected transfers don't appear in POS
- Real-time inventory updates ensure accurate stock levels

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Relationships
```
StockTransfer
├── belongsTo: fromBranch (Branch)
├── belongsTo: toBranch (Branch) 
├── belongsTo: creator (User)
├── belongsTo: processor (User)
└── hasMany: transferItems (StockTransferItem)

StockTransferItem
├── belongsTo: transfer (StockTransfer)
└── belongsTo: item (Item)

Inventory (Updated)
├── belongsTo: item (Item)
├── belongsTo: branch (Branch)
└── unique: [item_id, branch_id]
```

### Status Flow
```
Pending → Accept → Accepted (Inventory Updated)
        ↓
        Reject → Rejected (No Changes)
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /supervisor/stock-transfer` - Transfer history
- `GET /supervisor/stock-transfer/create` - Creation form
- `POST /supervisor/stock-transfer` - Store new transfer
- `GET /stock-transfer/pending` - Pending transfers for staff
- `POST /stock-transfer/{id}/accept` - Accept transfer
- `POST /stock-transfer/{id}/reject` - Reject transfer

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Login as Supervisor** (`supervisor@ravon.com` / `supervisor123`)
2. **Create Transfer**: Navigate to Stock Transfer → Create New Transfer
3. **Add Items**: Select items and verify availability checking
4. **Submit**: Create transfer and verify it appears in history
5. **Login as Staff** (branch staff for destination branch)
6. **View Pending**: Check pending transfers appear
7. **Accept Transfer**: Verify inventory updates correctly
8. **POS Verification**: Confirm updated stock appears in POS

### Edge Cases to Test
- Transfer quantity exceeding available stock
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Accepting already processed transfers
- Inventory consistency after multiple transfers

## Future Enhancements
- Email notifications for transfer status changes
- Transfer approval workflow for large quantities
- Bulk transfer operations
- Transfer history reporting and analytics
- Mobile-responsive optimizations

## Security Considerations
- All routes properly protected with middleware
- Authorization gates prevent unauthorized access
- Input validation prevents malicious data
- Database transactions ensure consistency
- CSRF protection on all forms
